# Bi-Modal Empathetic Response Generation
This project is implementation of Bi-Modal Response Generator model using audio and text modalities. the architecture of this model is showen in below picture. this model is combined of two models with diffrent tasks that are fine-tunined with their own dataset:
- task-1: Empathetic Response Generation using EmpatheticDialogues dataset
- task-2: Bi-Modal Emotion Recognition using MELD dataset</br>
After combining two models to get Bi-Modal Empathetic Response Generation, model is trained using [BiMEmpDialogues](https://github.com/zolfaShefreie/Multi-model_Empathetic_Dialogue_Dataset) dataset.
